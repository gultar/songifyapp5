A music to GIF converter

## Requirements

First, you need to have Node.js and NPM installed. Ideally, you're using a linux system or
Window Subsystem for Linux, but the environment still works on Window, with some possible limitations.

So, to install Node.js, you need to run the following commands:
```
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
```

Then install the Node.js package like so:
```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Or, simply visit the website and follow the steps provided.
